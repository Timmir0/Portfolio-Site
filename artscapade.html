			<p>Work in Progress</p>
			<p>[Game Designer, Programmer]</p>
			<p>A capstone project I am currently working with five other people with. You play as a security guard who is using a drone to defend the museum from thieves. The game is currently still a work in progress, with my team planning to have it completed Spring 2024.</p>

Two thieves are on the screen slightly with one of the drones heading towards them. Lines are on the minimap in the corner showing where the drones are heading." width="420" height="240"></div>

			<p>My main focus, so far, have been to create a system of movement for the drones the player controls as well as creating the AI for the thieves. The drones movement is slightly unusual, with the player being asked to draw lines from the drone to the drones destination. Thus the player has full control of multiple drone movements at the cost of it taking time to draw these out. We are seeking to make this drawing more integral as we go on with the inclusion of power ups in the near future. The drones also have a EMP skill I scripted that they can use to capture the thieves.</p>
			<p>The thief AI, meanwhile, is pretty simple, but with the ability to develope as the project continues. They have a set number of paths they can follow going towards one of the artpieces. However they aren't able to move while the camera is watching them. This is due to while trying to work towards keeping the thieves somewhat stealthy, they essentially teleport from one point to another. We plan to add more animation and make the thieves more complicated as the project goes on.</p>
			<p>I also developed the playtest UI, though there are plans to change that in a future build as we try to make the game easier to play. The minimap, however, has worked well for it's purposes, and has been well recieved during playtests.</p>
