			<p>This game is honestly one of my favorite solo projects I worked on. While the graphics are exceptionally basic due to both time and skill limitations, the game play surprisingly nice. I created a nice variety of enemies for this game including bats that just charge forward, slimes that shoot above them in a pattern, ghosts that fire towards the player, and wisps that fire sideways. I also made a fully operating boss that has different phases and multiple different attacks. I do hope to get the time to update this one day and release it in full for others to finally try out.</p>
