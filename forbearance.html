			<p>Created for Global Game Jam 2020, this is a collaborative board game created by Katherine Jay, Kathleen Kat Parker, and myself. The game takes place in an underwater research facility which the players have to work together to repair it in order to off fight the giant water bear that has the place under attack. A keen eye might notice similarities to Avalon Hill's "Betrayal at the House on the Hill", which was one of our main points of inspiration for this project. </p>

			<p>With this being a game jam project with a relatively small group, we each helped contribute a little to everything involved. My focus, however, was on the rules and mechanics of the game. With there being a lot of ideas on the table about how the game could run and limited time to work in, it was important to figure out what to cut so that we can finish the game in time.Â I also was the one in charge of bringing the game to playtest with others outside our group. This allowed us to know what was and wasn't working, and help refine our game further into what it is now.</p>
