			<p>The Great Unknown is a short side scrolling game where you take control of a little bird character trying to avoid obstacle and enemies to reach the portal that lies at the end of the stage. When I was building this game, one of the major things I tried to achieve with it is providing multiple ways to reach the exit. A number of moving platforms along with secrets areas were added to help build this feeling of exploration through the game.</p>

			<p>One of my prideful parts of this game are the sprites and animations in it. This is one of the first times I really forced myself to press my art muscles for this, creating some of my personal favorite animations for this game. My goal with each one making it rather clear what the character was actively doing on screen while also keeping some personality to both the bird character you play as along with the ghost like wisp enemies that haunt this floating world.</p>
