			<p>Created for Global Game Jam 2022, Twilit Wisps is a short puzzle game where you play as two characters simultaneously. The goal of the game is to guide each character to the goal of each level by solving simple puzzles.</p>

			<p>The level design of the game is rather simplistic. With the goal to focus on telling the player exactly what they need to know without being overbearing on details. The first few levels of the game help teach the player the basic mechanics without the need to tell them exactly what they are suppose to do. It allows the player to learn through experimentation and doing, so when levels come up later on that start layering these practices, the player already has an idea on what to do and just needs to figure out how to do it.</p>
